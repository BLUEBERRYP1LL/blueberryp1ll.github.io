## Ramil Kraft | Aspiring Penetration Tester

Hello and welcome. I am a motivated IT specialist in training with a clear focus on cybersecurity. My goal is to understand complex systems and learn how to secure them effectively.

Rather than relying on theory alone, I am committed to continuous, hands-on learning to build and validate my skills. This portfolio serves as a demonstration of my technical abilities and problem-solving approach.

**Key Milestones:**

* **August 2023:** Began vocational training as an IT Specialist.
* **October 2023:** Successfully compromised my first machine on Hack The Box, igniting my passion for pentesting.
* **April 2025:** Earned the **Hack The Box Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS)** certification as a validation of my practical skills.

I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge and make a valuable contribution to a security team. Please feel free to explore my write-ups for an insight into my methodology.
